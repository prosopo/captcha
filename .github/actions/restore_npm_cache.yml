            # note that restoring a cache in github is a pain. The trailing '-' matches any string after the '-', therefore 'abc-' would match a cache named 'abc-1234' or 'abc-5678', etc.
            # the problem is 'abc-' will not match a cache named 'abc'! So if you're using wildcard cache name selectors like this, you need a field that changes as the suffix to become the wildcard
            # here we're setting the key to an unused cache key so it falls back to the wildcard selector in `restore-keys`
