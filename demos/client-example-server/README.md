# client-example-server

This example server implements signup, login and authorisation methods for a typical node backend application. The code
is based
on [an article written by Agustin Fernandez](https://www.asapdevelopers.com/build-a-react-native-login-app-with-node-js-backend/)
and is adapted to use a Mongo In-Memory Database.
