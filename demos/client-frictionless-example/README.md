# Getting Started with the Frictionless Client Example

This project is a _minimal_ example demonstrating how to include Prosopo Frictionless Procaptcha in a client React app. To read more about how to set up Procaptcha, [check out this blogpost](https://prosopo.io/articles/how-to-deploy-prosopo-procaptcha-on-your-website-or-app/).

## How does it work?

Without compromising user privacy, users are assessed on how botlike they appear. In almost all cases of genuine human traffic, this results in no Procaptcha challenge having to be completed.

When users are suspected of being a bot, they are faced with a visual Procaptcha challenge. The higher their percieved threat score, the more challenging the Procaptcha will be.
