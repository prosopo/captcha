[Sign up for free](https://prosopo.io/register) and get your sitekey today. You need a sitekey to use
this library.

## Get Started

See our [docs](https://docs.prosopo.io) for help setting up Procaptcha on your website or in your app.

## Development Environment

The monorepo for the Prosopo Procaptcha bot protection software includes open source packages associated
with [Procaptcha](https://prosopo.io/products/gdpr-compliant-captcha/).

See [for-devs.md](for-devs.md) for information on setting up your development environment.

You can run this software as a self-hosted bot protection solution. All of the required software is open source with the
exception of the client-side detection library, for obvious reasons. [Contact us](https://prosopo.io/contact/) if you
need help.
