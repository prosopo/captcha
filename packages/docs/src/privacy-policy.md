At Prosopo Limited ("we", "us", or "our") we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and personal data
in compliance with the law and guidelines of the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, process and keep your data safe when you visit and use our

### 1.2 Who is Your Data Controller and Data Protection Officer

Prosopo Limited is your Data Controller and responsible for your Personal Data.
We have appointed a data protection officer ("DPO") who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this
Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal
rights surrounding your Personal Data please contact the Data Protection Officer at&nbsp;data@prosopo.io or postal

You have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data
protection issues ([www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your
concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.

### 1.3 Processing Data on Behalf of a Controller and Processors’ responsibility to you

In discharging the responsibilities of the Data Controller, we have Processors who deal with your data on behalf of the
Data Controller. Therefore, the responsibilities described below may be assigned to an individual, or may be taken to
apply to the organisation as a whole. The Data Processor has the following responsibilities:

- Ensure that all processing of Personal Data is governed by one of the legal bases laid out in the GDPR (see 2.2 below
  for more information on those bases).
- Ensure that persons authorised to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
  appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality
- Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
  associated with the processing of Personal Data
- Obtain the prior specific or general written authorisation of the Controller before engaging another Processor
- Assist the Controller in the fulfilment of the Controller’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data
  subject’s rights
- Make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in
  the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor
  mandated by the Controller
- Maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a Controller
- Cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks
- Ensure that any person acting under the authority of the Processor who has access to Personal Data does not process
  them except on instructions from the Controller
- Notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach
- Designate a data protection officer where required by the GDPR, publish their details and communicate them to the
  supervisory authority
- Support the data protection officer in performing their tasks by providing resources necessary to carry out those
  tasks and access to Personal Data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge

## Legal Basis for Data Collection

### 2.1 Types of Data / Privacy Policy Scope

Personal Data means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include
data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we have grouped together below.
Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we
collect:
If you sign up to use Prosopo and create a profile this will include:

- **Profile/Identity Data**: name.
- **Contact Data** includes, email address.
- **Communications Data** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your communication preferences.

&nbsp;
If you purchase a product on the platform this will include:

- **Billing Data:** debit/credit card holder information (name/billing address) of whoever purchased something from
  Prosopo (processed by a third party card or cryptocurrency payments processor, such as Stripe or Coinbase)
- **Financial Data:** Although we rely on a third party to retain and store your credit/debit card / crypto address
  information, we do not retain it ourselves.
- **Transaction Data** includes details about payments from you for products and purchases you have made from Prosopo.

If you log onto the platform or contact us through our live-chat software:

- **Technical Data**: internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location,
  operating
  system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.
- **Customer Support Data** includes feedback and survey responses. If you have done a webchat or contacted us by email
  or on live-chat we will retain a record of that conversation
- **Usage Data** includes information about how you use our website, products and services.
  <br>

  We may use anonymous data collected from Prosopo Limited for site administration, analytics, advertising and
  promotional purposes, and we may share such information with other entities (such as service providers) for such
  purposes. We may also aggregate data to enable research or analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and
  others. For example, we may conduct research on your demographics and usage. Although this aggregated data may be
  based
  in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally. Prosopo may share this type of anonymous data with
  others, including service providers, our affiliates, agents and current and prospective business partners.
  We may use your anonymous data outside Prosopo to improve third party marketing or use your data in combination with
  third party data to improve your experiences both in and outside Prosopo. We may retain your IP address and/or other
  device-identifying data in order to help us diagnose problems with our servers, to administer Prosopo including
  personalizing content or links relevant to your geographic area or device-type, to verify that your account is not
  being used by others, to gather broad anonymous demographic data (such as the number of visitors from a geographic
  area),
  to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use for our Site, Terms of Service or otherwise in order to protect our
  services, Site, Platform, Users, or other third parties. We use analysis tools including Google Analytics, HubSpot
  and/or
  others. These provide us with information about how our users use the Site or Platform.
  We do not collect any **Special Categories of Personal Data** about you (this includes details about your race or
  ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union
  membership,
  information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal
  convictions and offences.

<br>

### 2.2 The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data

There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing of Personal Data. The main
avenues we rely on are:

- **Consent**: Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that confirms you
  are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or ‘opt in’ to a service.
- **Contractual Obligations**: We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our contractual
  obligations and provide you with the promised service.
- **Legal Compliance**: We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such as fraudulent activity
  or other illegal actions.
- **Legitimate Interest**: We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to meet our legitimate
  interests – this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will not have a
  material impact on your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that the platform can include
  that address at the bottom of forms it generates, such as invoices.

<br>

## How is your Personal Data Collected?

### 3.1 Direct Interactions

You may give us your identity, contact and financial data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by phone,
email or otherwise. This includes Personal Data you provide when you:

- Inquire about or purchase our products or services and go on to use them
- Speak to our support team using our live-chat support
- Create an account on our Platform
- Request marketing to be sent to you
- Give us feedback or contact us

<br>

### 3.2 Automated Technologies or Interactions

As you interact with our Site or Platform, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing
actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Data by using cookies and other similar technologies. Please see
our [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy)&nbsp;for more information.

### 3.3 Third-parties or Publicly Available Sources

We will receive Personal Data about you from various third parties including:

- Analytics providers such as Google
- Advertising networks such as LinkedIn and Google
- Financial and Transaction Data from providers of payment and delivery services such as Stripe
- Identity and Contact data from publicly available sources such as Companies House.

### 4.2 Marketing and Content Updates

You will receive marketing and new content communications from us if you have created an account and by doing so opt
into receiving those communications.&nbsp; From time to time we may make suggestions and recommendations to you about
goods or services that may be of interest to you.

### 4.3 Change of Purpose

We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an
explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact our
Data Protection Officer.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis
which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above
rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## Your rights and how you are protected by us

### 5.1 What Control Do I Have Over Prosopo’s Use Of My Personal Data?

You may delete your account at any time – this will remove your account page from the Platform and our related software.
We do not guarantee the ability to delete all stored data. If you would like us to delete/correct personally
identifiable data, let us know and we will action your request as soon as practicable.
Your account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized
access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting
access to your computer or device and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
You can access information associated with your account by logging into Prosopo.
California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to
ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates
and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.
If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to
data@prosopo.io

### 5.2 How Does Prosopo Protect Customer Data?

We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. We implement a variety
of security measures to ensure the security of your Personal Data on our systems. Any Personal Data collected by us is
contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights
to such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. Where sensitive data is collected by us it will be
transmitted and protected via a secure protocol and encrypted in our databases to be accessed only as stated above. If
and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to
security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately, no
transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not
under the control of Prosopo to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive
to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any
such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please
contact us.

### 5.3 Opting Out Of Marketing Promotions

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time at
unsubscribe@prosopo.io.
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will continue to retain Personal Data provided to us as a
result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions.

### 5.4 How to Request your Data and the Process for Obtaining it

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your
request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity (for example we may ask how you
are related to the User in question) and ensure you have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any
of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no
right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
our response.

## Your data and third parties

### 6.1 Will We Share Your Data With Third Parties?

We may share non-personal data with third parties to, for example (but not by way of limitation), improve Prosopo and
to
enable data aggregation as described above.
We may share your Personal Data with subcontractors (only when necessary and with your consent) or affiliates (subject
to confidentiality obligations to use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them and pursuant to our
instructions).
We may also share Personal Data with interested parties in the event that Prosopo anticipates a change in control or the
acquisition of all or part of our business or assets or with interested parties in connection with the licensing of our
technology.
If Prosopo is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal
Data to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the
acquiring entity may govern the further use of your Personal Data. In all other situations your data will still remain
protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time).
We may share your Personal Data at any time if required for legal reasons or in order to enforce our Terms of Use for
our Site/Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.

### 6.2 Third-Party Links

This Site may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling
those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party
websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our Site, we encourage you to read the
privacy policy of every website you visit.

## How long we will retain your data for?

We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.
For example, we are bound to retain your User profile information so that we can monitor the bot protection service
we are providing to your website. In contrast, conversations
you have with us over email or through our live chat software will be retained while the matter is ongoing, but once our
conversation ends we may delete the record of that conversation.
&nbsp;
We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period than usual in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe
there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

## Age limits for our users

You must not use Prosopo unless you are aged 18 or older. If you are under 18 and you access Prosopo by lying about your
age, or are otherwise in breach of our Terms of Use for our Site or Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you must
immediately stop using Prosopo and terminate your Account.
This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

## International transfer of data

Your information may be stored and processed in the US or other countries or jurisdictions outside the US where Prosopo
has facilities. We are currently storing data in the EU and so, by using Prosopo, you are permitting and consenting to
the transfer of information, including personal data, outside the US.

## Notification of changes and acceptance of policy

We keep our Privacy Policy under review and will place any updates on this webpage. This version is dated Sep 25th 2023.
By using Prosopo, you consent to the collection and use of data by us as set out in this Privacy Policy. Continued
access or use of Prosopo shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to this Privacy Policy.

## Interpretation

All uses of the word "including" mean "including but not limited to" and the enumerated examples are not intended to in
any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set out in this policy may be used solely for
the purpose for which they are stated to be provided, and any unrelated correspondence&nbsp; will be ignored. Unless
otherwise required by law, we reserve the right to not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject
matter for which we have provided an email address. As a matter of common sense, you are more likely to get a reply if
your request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your
concern or question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website etc.).
Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of Prosopo, waive rights or make representations (whether contractual
or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Prosopo address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms
or any official public announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any Prosopo
rights, the email content shall be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine
correspondence expressed to be from the Prosopo legal department.

## Terms of use / Terms of service

Please also see our [Terms and Conditions](/terms-and-conditions) for our Site, Platform, and Services which set
out the terms, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing your use of Prosopo.
