# Prosopo Provider Command Line Interface

The Provier CLI allows you to set up a Provider instance and begin to serve CAPTCHA challenges to the Prosopo Network.
This will allow you to obtain valuable human-labelled image data. As we are currently in beta testing, the CLI is **only
useable for development purposes**.

The Provider CLI is intended to be used from within the Prosopo Provider Container Image. It is not intended to be used
directly from the host machine. A bundled version of the CLI is available in the Provider Container Image.

## Container Image

### Get the Container ID

To execute commands against the running Provider, you must first get the Container ID of the running Provider Container.

    ```bash
    $ PROVIDER_CONTAINER = docker ps -q -f name=docker-provider
    ```

### Execute a command inside the provider container

You can then execute the commands as follows:

    ```bash
    $ docker exec -it $PROVIDER_CONTAINER bash -c "npx provider <command>"
    ```

### Executing Commands in the Container

### Register your Provider

You must first register your Provider in the network contract in order to be selected as a CAPTCHA Provider.

```bash
$ npx provider provider_register --url https://YOUR_URL --fee 0 --payee Dapp
```

### Fund your Provider

It is necessary to fund your Provider with at least the minimum fee amount in order to serve CAPTCHA challenges. The
funds are used to incentivise good behaviour by Providers.

```bash
$ npx provider provider_update --value 1000 --address YOUR_ADDRESS
```

### Set a new Dataset

You must load a dataset in to your database in order to provider CAPTCHA challenges. The dataset contains the CAPTCHA
challenges that will be served to users. The format for the dataset is
defined [here](https://github.com/prosopo/captcha/blob/main/packages/types/src/datasets/dataset.ts) and an example
dataset can be seen [here](https://github.com/prosopo/captcha/blob/main/dev/data/captchas.json).

```bash
$ npx provider provider_set_data_set --file /path/to/dataset.json
```

### Start the API

Start the API and a begin to serve CAPTCHA challenges.

```bash
$ npx provider start
```

### Deregister your Provider

When you no longer wish to be part of the Prosopo Network, you can stop serving CAPTCHA challenges by deregistering.

```bash
$ npx provider provider_deregister
```

### List details of a single Provider

```bash
$ npx provider provider_details --address PROVIDER_ADDRESS
```

### Get a list of provider accounts from the contract

```bash
$ npx provider provider_accounts
```

### View the Provider Version

```bash
$ npx provider version
```
